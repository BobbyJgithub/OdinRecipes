# recipes
A test repo for learning the basics of HTML and Git. I will demonstrate my knowledge so far by creating a website that lists recipes for several foods.

I have learned how to organize files in a site.
Use elements in HTML to display content and link to other webpages.
Use Git to commint saves and push to the main repository.
