                <li>- 2 cups glutinous rice flour (also known as sweet rice flour)</li>
                <li>- 1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
                <li>- 1 1/2 cups water</li>

            <h4>Instructions:</h4>

            <ol>
                <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the glutinous rice flour and sugar.</li>
                <li>Gradually add water while stirring continuously to create a smooth and well-mixed batter.</li>
                <li>Pour the mixture into a heatproof dish or a silicone mold.</li>
                <li>Steam the mixture over high heat for about 30-40 minutes, or until it becomes firm and translucent.</li>
                <li>Allow the mochi to cool completely.</li>
                <li>Dust a clean surface with potato starch or cornstarch to prevent sticking.</li>
                <li>Carefully turn the mochi out of the dish or mold onto the starch-dusted surface.</li>
                <li>Use a sharp knife to cut the mochi into desired shapes. You can cut it into squares, wrap it 
                    around sweet fillings, or shape it into small rounds.</li>
                <li>Dust the cut mochi pieces with more starch to prevent them from sticking together.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

            <p class="fn">Sweet mochi can be enjoyed on its own or filled with various fillings like red bean paste, strawberries, or ice cream. 
                It's a delightful treat that's often served on special occasions and holidays in Japan.</p>

            <p class="note">Note: When working with mochi, it's important to handle it with lightly starched hands and tools to prevent sticking. 
                Additionally, mochi is best consumed within a day or two of making it, as it tends to dry out over time.</p>
