            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Delicious ramen is a popular Japanese noodle dish known for its flavorful broth and customizable toppings. 
                It consists of chewy wheat noodles served in a savory soup base, often flavored with soy sauce, miso, or 
                pork bones.</p>
                
            <p>The broth is the heart of a good ramen, and it can be simmered for hours to achieve a rich, complex flavor. 
                It's then combined with toppings like sliced green onions, bamboo shoots, soft-boiled eggs, seaweed, and 
                various meats such as pork belly or chicken.</p>
                
            <p>Ramen is a versatile dish that can be tailored to individual tastes. Whether you prefer a spicy miso broth 
                or a classic shoyu (soy sauce) base, there are endless variations to explore. It's a comforting and satisfying 
                meal that's perfect for warming up on a chilly day.</p>
