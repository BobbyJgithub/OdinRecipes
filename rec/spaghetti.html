            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Delicious spaghetti is a classic Italian dish known for its simplicity and bold flavors. It consists of 
                long, thin pasta strands typically served with a savory tomato sauce and various toppings.</p>
                
            <p>The pasta is usually cooked al dente and tossed in a flavorful sauce made from ripe tomatoes, garlic, 
                onions, and herbs. It can be customized with additional ingredients like meatballs, sausage, mushrooms, 
                or fresh basil to suit individual preferences.</p>

                and a sprinkling of grated Parmesan cheese. It's a popular choice for quick weeknight dinners and is also 
                perfect for entertaining guests with a hearty, satisfying meal.</p>
