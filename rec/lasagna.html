            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Yummy lasagna is a classic Italian dish that is known for its rich and comforting flavors. 
                It is typically made by layering flat pasta sheets with a combination of ingredients such as 
                ricotta cheese, mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, tomato sauce, ground meat (like beef or pork), 
                and sometimes vegetables like spinach or mushrooms.</p>
                
            <p>The pasta sheets are often pre-cooked or layered with a sauce to ensure they cook properly in the oven. 
                Each layer is assembled in a baking dish, creating a hearty and substantial casserole. The top layer is 
                usually finished with a generous sprinkle of cheese to create a golden, bubbly crust when baked.</p>
                
            <p>The flavors of the ingredients meld together during baking, creating a harmonious combination of creamy, 
                cheesy, meaty, and tomatoey goodness. The dish is then served in squares, allowing each bite to contain a 
                delightful mixture of flavors and textures.</p>
                
            <p>Yummy lasagna is often accompanied by a side salad and garlic bread, making it a popular and satisfying meal 
                for gatherings or family dinners. It's a versatile dish that can be customized to suit individual tastes, and 
                it's beloved by many for its comforting and indulgent qualities.</p>

            <h4>Instructions:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large skillet or saucepan, cook the ground meat over medium-high heat until evenly browned. 
                    Add the chopped onion and garlic, and cook until the onion is translucent. Drain excess fat.</li>
                <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Add sugar, basil, fennel seeds, 
                    Italian seasoning, 1 tablespoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer, covered, for 
                    about 1.5 to 2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
                <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese, egg, remaining parsley, and 3/4 teaspoon salt. Mix well and set aside.</li>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
                <li>To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. 
                    Arrange a single layer of lasagna noodles over the sauce. Spread with one-half of the ricotta cheese mixture. 
                    Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon a third of the meat sauce over the cheese. Repeat layers, 
                    ending with the sauce.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle Parmesan cheese on top.</li>
                <li>Cover with aluminum foil (make sure it doesn't touch the cheese) and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes, or until the lasagna is bubbly and golden.</li>
                <li>Let it stand for 10 minutes before serving to allow the lasagna to set.</li>
