            <h4>Instructions:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large skillet, cook the ground beef over medium-high heat until it's browned and crumbled. 
                    Drain any excess fat from the skillet.</li>
                <li>Add the chopped onion and minced garlic to the beef, and cook for a few minutes until the onion becomes translucent.</li>
                <li>Stir in the taco seasoning mix (or your homemade spice blend) and add the water. 
                    Simmer for a few minutes, allowing the mixture to thicken and absorb the flavors. Then, remove it from the heat.</li>
                <li>While the beef is cooking, warm the tortillas in a dry skillet or microwave them for about 15-20 
                    seconds until they are pliable.</li>
                <li>To assemble your tacos, place a spoonful of the beef mixture in the center of each tortilla.</li>
                <li>Top the beef with shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, cheese, sour cream, salsa, and any other desired toppings.</li>
                <li>If you like it spicy, you can add some sliced jalapeños.</li>
                <li>Garnish your tacos with fresh cilantro, and serve them with lime wedges on the side for squeezing over the top.</li>
                <li>Fold the tortillas in half, creating a taco shape, and enjoy your homemade beef tacos!</li>
            </ol>
