        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pretzels are a classic baked snack known for their twisted knot shape and distinctive flavor. They are soft on the 
            inside with a slightly crisp exterior and a delightful touch of salt. Pretzels are a favorite at parties, 
            gatherings, or simply as a satisfying treat.</p>

        <p>For Boiling and Topping:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>- 10 cups water</li>

        <h4>Instructions:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small bowl, combine warm water, sugar, and salt. Sprinkle the yeast over the mixture and let it sit for 
                about 5 minutes until it becomes frothy.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, add the flour and pour in the yeast mixture. Stir until a dough forms.</li>
            <li>Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.</li>
            <li>Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rise for about 1 hour, or until it has 
                doubled in size.</li>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 450°F (230°C) and line baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>In a large pot, bring the 10 cups of water and baking soda to a rolling boil.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough into equal portions and roll each portion into a long rope. Twist the rope into a pretzel shape.</li>
            <li>Place the pretzels, one at a time, into the boiling water for about 30 seconds. Remove them with a slotted spoon 
                and place them on the prepared baking sheets.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the pretzels with coarse sea salt while they are still wet from the water bath.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for about 12-15 minutes, or until the pretzels are golden brown.</li>
            <li>Allow the pretzels to cool slightly before serving.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
