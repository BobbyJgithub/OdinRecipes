        <h4>Instructions:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until the mixture 
                is light and fluffy.</li>
            <li>Beat in the eggs, one at a time, then stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Gradually add this dry 
                mixture to the butter and sugar mixture, mixing until just combined.</li>
            <li>Stir in the chocolate chips (and any additional add-ins like nuts or dried fruits if desired).</li>
            <li>Drop rounded tablespoons of cookie dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown. The centers may still 
                appear slightly soft.</li>
            <li>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to wire racks to cool 
                completely.</li>
            <li>Store in an airtight container for up to a week (if they last that long!).</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
